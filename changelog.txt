0.1.1
  * Restructuring to match nimble's requirements, and also a bit of refactoring.

  * Note: This version changes how fields are stored!

    In version < 0.1.1 fields were stored as a pair with the data for each row and column.
    Now, fields are stored within the `SQLQuery` object, and are accessed via integer index using the `fields` proc.
  
  * Fixes to internal string allocations and processing.

  TODO: Time fields are not returning nanoseconds.
